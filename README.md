# JavaScript-Projects
Here are some small projects I made using JavaScript. 

<h1>Projects</h1> 

<ul> 
  <h2>Pizza Menu</h2> 
 <p>This project is a menu used to order pizza and add toppings. It calculates and recalls the order. </p>
  <h2>Tic-Tac-Toe Game</h2> 
  <p>This is my spin on tic-tac-toe the game we all love while waiting on our food at a restaurant. Instead of x's and o's I used kisses and hearts.</p> 
  <h2>Calculator</h2> 
  <p>This is a very basic calculator that can add, subtract, multiply and divide!</p>
  </ul>
